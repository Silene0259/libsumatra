# libsumatra

Sumatra is a block-lattice styled chain that uses something known as a `pivot` to create indepedent domains for access on the block lattice. The block lattice has multiple functions and many different forms of blocks. These can cross-communicate with other parts of the system.

This is still a work in progress.
